MINOR:
- extend gpioset/get with options to specify the wait time etc.
- build tools conditionally
- unify the help messages for all tools

MAJOR:
- create gpioctld - a daemon controlling the GPIOs so that we can
  request and then keep the line reserved until we want it released
- create gpioctl - a program controlling the daemon
