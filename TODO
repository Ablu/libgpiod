- create a low-level request routine accepting a structure containing request
  configuration
- for high-level request functions separate the polarity and direction settings
  from other flags
- create a routine for finding GPIO lines by name (plus an extended version
  requesting the line too)
- separate the line information logic updates, make it run in the background
  after requesting/releasing lines and find a way to inform users of failures
  to update line info
- create a set of functions for requesting/waiting for events on lines
