MINOR:
- create a high level routine for listening on events on a GPIO line
- rethink the GPIO event API
- extend gpioset/get with options to specify the wait time etc.
- add versioning
- build tools conditionally
- improve the way bulk line request work - keep track of common request
  structs better

MAJOR:
- create gpioctld - a daemon controlling the GPIOs so that we can
  request and then keep the line reserved until we want it released
- create gpioctl - a program controlling the daemon
