    libgpiod - C library and tools for interacting with the linux GPIO
               character device

Since linux 4.7 the GPIO sysfs interface is deprecated. User space should use
the character device instead. This library encapsulates the ioctl calls and
data structures behind a straightforward API.

This is still work-in-progress and no interfaces are stable yet.

Contributions are welcome - please use github pull-requests and stick to the
linux kernel coding style.
