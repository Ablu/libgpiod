libgpiod v0.1.3
===============

Bug fixes:
- this time the bug making it impossible to request both types of line events
  was really fixed
- pass the O_CLOEXEC flag to open() when opening the GPIO chip device file

libgpiod v0.1.2
===============

Bug fixes:
- include <poll.h> instead of <sys/poll.h> in gpioset
- fix a formatting issue in gpioinfo for chips with >100 GPIO lines
- fix a bug when requesting both-edges event notifications

libgpiod v0.1.1
===============

Bug fixes:
- fix short options in gpiomon (short opt for --silent was missing)
- correct the kernel headers requirements in README
- include <time.h> for struct timespec
- include <poll.h> instead of <sys/poll.h>
- detect the version of strerror_r()

libgpiod v0.1
=============

First version of libgpiod.

It's currently possible to:
- get and set the values of multiple GPIO lines with a single function call
- monitor a GPIO line for events
- enumerate all GPIO chips present in the system
- enumerate all GPIO lines exposed by a chip
- extract information about GPIO chips (label, name, number of lines)
- extract information about GPIO lines (name, flags, state, user)

Tools provided with the library are:
- gpioget - read values from GPIO lines
- gpioset - set values of GPIO lines
- gpiodetect - list GPIO chips
- gpioinfo - print info about GPIO lines exposed by a chip
- gpiomon - monitor a GPIO line for events
- gpiofind - find a GPIO line by name
